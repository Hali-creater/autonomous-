# autonomous-
This project is building a Python-based autonomous trading agent designed to execute trades automatically in financial markets. The agent employs a sophisticated trading strategy that combines Price-Volume-Gradient (PVG) analysis, Smart Money Concepts (SMC), and Trend-Pullback-Reversal (TPR) patterns to identify high-probability trade setups.
